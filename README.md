# 3DOF_PPM
Design and link length optimization for a given workspace of a 3DoF Planar Parallel Mechanism.
This is a combination of a 2Dof 5-bar planar parallel mechanism (position control) and a slider crank mechanism (orientation control). 

The formal description is a 2-RRR 1-PRR manipulator, i.e., two limbs with three rotary
joints and one limb with a prismatic joint to base and two rotary joints and where all the
base joints are actuated. The below figure illustrates the aforementioned manipulator.
